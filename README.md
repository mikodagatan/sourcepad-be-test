## Why does Docker only have DB?

Dockerized Rails is quite difficult for onboarding based on experience. I had a lot of experience with creating and joining a Dockerized Rails app, and I don't mind the hassles. But, I think I got to make it a habit to use DB-dockerized Rails as some people mind the difficulty.

## Tech Stack

- Rails 7
- Ruby 3.1.0
- Blueprinter
